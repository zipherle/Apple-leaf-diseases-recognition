## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for building a deep learning model based on ResNet architecture to detect and classify different diseases in apple leaves. The system aims to enhance decision-making in agriculture through automated disease recognition.

## Features
- Preprocessing pipeline for apple leaf images.
- Implementation of ResNet for disease recognition.
- Evaluation metrics for model performance.
- Support for transfer learning and fine-tuning.
- Interactive visualization of results.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zipherle/Apple-leaf-diseases-recognition.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Apple-leaf-diseases-recognition
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```
4. Use the model for predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image <path_to_image>
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset should include labeled images of apple leaves affected by different diseases. Ensure the dataset is structured as follows:
```
data/
├── train/
├── val/
└── test/
```

## Model
The project uses a ResNet model, which is pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on the apple leaf disease dataset. Adjustments to the architecture and hyperparameters can be made in `config.py`.

## Results
Include the evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for the trained model. Add visualizations of predictions if available.
